Storage Database Security / Hosting

Overview

As we are leading towards the deployment stage of the Art Gallery Application will need to
start looking at storage options for the data that is stored from the website.(This can be further
discussed with the client)

Depending on the needs of the database there are multiple options that can be chosen from the list
of Database hosting website. The most well known being AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM and Dell EMC.

Due to the website having login credentials and a payment system and other documents and information
that may be collected from the website a Database will need to be implemented. Chosen by the Art
Gallery Team we will be using Google Cloud as the deployment method for the web application
therefore ill be talking in regards to their database system.

Data Protection, Google Cloud automatically encrypts data, is SSAE 16, ISO 27001 and PCI DSS
compliant, and supports HIPAA.

Cloud SQL data is encrypted when on googles internal networks and when stored in database tables,
temporary files and backups. This creates a safety net for if there was a data breach or a malicious
user reading internal traffic. Cloud SQL also includes a network firewall, allowing for application
managers to control the network access.

Cloud Storage also offers secure-by-design features to protect data and allow for advanced controls.
